# Alfred

A simulation where Alfred chases Batman around the batcave, picking up dirty socks Batman leaves behind.

To run the simulation, do

```
python simulation.py 
```

and see the results displayed in the terminal.

Currently, Alfred just tries to follow Batman, without regard for where the socks are, but the next step is to use ML (maybe reinforcement learning) to have him pick up more socks.
